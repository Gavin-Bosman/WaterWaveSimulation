The goal of this project is to:
  - Provide a scientifically accurate and visually appealing 2D simulation of ocean water waves
  - Including:
    - Realistic dynamics and aesthetics
    - Interactivity, with responses to objects of varying shape/mass being dropped
    - Varying external forces/wind conditions

We hope you appreciate our work as much as we do.
