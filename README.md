Simulation and Modelling - Final Project

The goal of this project is to at the minimum:
  - Provide an scientifically accurate 2D simulation of water
  - Including:
    - Reaction to objects of varying shape/mass being dropped
    - Varying temp/wind conditions
    
If all of the above can be achieved within the time constraints, we would like to attempt to expand into 3D
